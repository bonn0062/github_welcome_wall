# Introduction


# Welcome!

### First off, thank you for considering contributing to this GitHub welcome wall. 
It's people like you that make this such a fantastic place to be!

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the everyone learning, managing, and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your questions, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### All we're looking for from you is a warm and welcoming message to the people who come after you. 
We're all here to learn, so let people know that they can do it! Let people know that they are welcome to be here too.

> This is an open source project and I love to receive contributions from the community — you! There are many ways to contribute, so keep an open mind and think outside the box.
>
>I'm only looking for positive, warm, and welcoming messages. If you have something negative to communicate, please leave that pretty much anywhere else. Images, messages, and ideas that communicate negativity will not be approved.


# Ground Rules
Don't be a jerk! Be positive, be welcoming. Add your message here and then get out there and keep learning!

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct for a better description of what I mean](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Help!
Not sure how you got here or how to get started? This is the repo for the article that will explain exactly that, [WTH am I doing here? The absolute beginner's guide to Git and GitHub](https://).

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn more from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).


At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first 

If a I ask you to "rebase" your PR, I'm saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Notify me personally, please.
>
>It's unlikely you'll need to file an issue here. If you decide to file an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of your software are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

# Just so you know
I look at Pull Requests on a regular basis. I'm doing this on my own, so it might take a little time before I get to every pull request, but I promise I will!
> If feedback has been given, I expect responses within one month. After one month, I may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity. Chances are, though, if you are submitting a simple note or image, your change will be merged without feedback. I'm just putting this here for the rare instance that I might need a little more information from you before adding your message to the repository.
